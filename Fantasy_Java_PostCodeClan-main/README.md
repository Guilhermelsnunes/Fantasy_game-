WORK IN PROGRESS...

Fantasy Adventure Games! (JAVA)


The project is to model a fantasy adventure. The game has players, that have a number of health points and weapons/spells. Players fall into different categories:

Dwarves, Barbarians and Knights.
Each of these have a weapon and fight with other players (Sword, Axe and Club)
They should be able to change their weapon at any point in the game.

Warlocks and Wizards.
They are able to cast spells on others (Fireball and Lightning Strike).
They have a mythical creature (Ogre and Dragon) who will defend them from attackers.
They should be able to change spells or creature at any point in the game.

Clerics.
They will have healing tools with which they can heal other players (potion and herbs).
They are able to change healing tool at any point in the game.

The game also has rooms to work through. Each room either have some kind of treasure (Gold and Gems) to collect or an Enemy (Troll and Orc) to defeat before moving on.
